## Off-Grid. Decentralized. Together.

We are a group of enthusiasts dedicated to creating a robust mesh data network that works even when the traditional internet doesn't. 

### Why Mesh?
* **Resilience:** Works during local emergencies.
* **Open Access:** Owned by the community.
* **Local:** Connecting neighbors in the IWV.
